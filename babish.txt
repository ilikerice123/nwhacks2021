This week I'm a little under the weather,
--
But that's not gonna stop me from teaching you how to make bread.
--
A process that takes a little more than plain old flour, and turns it into something delicious
--
You can actually eat.
--
Let's get down to basics

--
All right, so we're gonna start off with Jim Lahey's now-famous: No-Knead bread technique
--
this is gonna start with
--
400 grams of bread flour. Bread flour has a higher protein content and, it's going to help us develop better gluten in our bread
--
To this we are going to add one gram, or 1/4 teaspoon, of any kind of yeast, instant or active dry
--
We're gonna whisk these together with our cute little whisk and then we're going to add about 10 grams, or one and a half teaspoons,
--
Of kosher salt. If you use table salt, keep it at 10 grams,
--
But use more like three-quarters of a teaspoon
--
Then to this we're going to add one and 1/3 cups of room-temperature water. And here's where the easy part starts.
--
We're going to gently mix the whole affair together, until a rough ball of dough forms.
--
No kneading as they say. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours, or until it
--
looks like this. Lacy, filled with big beautiful bubbles, and reeking of
--
Fermentation. And we're going to turn this out onto a very heavily floured work surface
--
Now in this step we're just trying to punch it down and shape it
--
We're not trying to work any of the flour into the dough. So make sure that you're not needing it
--
we're just grabbing the corners and pulling them in towards the center until we have a heavily floured smooth and taut top to our
--
Loaf once you've got a large round smooth surface start pulling the dough in towards the bottom
--
Shaping it into a little pool as it's called and placing onto some flour
--
Parchment paper and now we're going to heavily dust and clean kitchen towel
--
I hope I don't have to stay clean
--
But you know
--
Don't be a monster use a clean towel and flour it liberally so it does not stick to the dough because it's going to cover
--
The dough for the next one to two hours or until it has grown by about 50% not quite double during this time
--
we're preheating our oven as hot as it can go with a
--
cast-iron Dutch oven inside of it for at least an hour
--
Then we are cutting our parchment paper down to size for easy droppage scoring the top of the loaf with
--
Pattern you like using a bread knife or a razor blade and dropping below rectly into our preheated cast iron then right before we cover
--
It in place in the oven we're going to spray it down. Liberally with plain old water
--
this is gonna help the ovens spring as it's called or the
--
Rising that the bread does in the oven with a little grimace at how hot our oven is
--
We're and make this guy for about 30 minutes removing the lid and giving it one last spritz of water
--
But halfway through the baking process at the end of which we are going to be
--
Rewarded with a site that looks a little bit like this and trust me
--
There are very few sensations in life finer than smelling the bread that you've made from scratch emerge from the oven
--
But we've got to be patient and let this guy cool completely before digging in about two hours
--
I know that's a long time to wait
--
But you will ruin the texture of your bread if you cut into it too early now
--
There are a thousand different factors that can change the size of the holes and the crumb of your bread to the brownness of its
--
Crust to the largeness of its oven spring but the no need method is a very reliable way to end up with a delicious loaf
--
Almost every time we'll cover the trickier techniques in the bread part two. But for now it's time to move on to another easy riser
--
So to speak that's right
--
Focaccia with a recipe adapted from bone Appetit into the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook affixed
--
We are dumping 850 grams of bread flour followed by 2 and 1/2 cups of room-temperature water
--
We're gonna mix those on low speed for a few minutes while they're mixing
--
We're going to combine a half a cup of water measuring about 105 degrees Fahrenheit with a whole packet of active dry yeast
--
along with a small pinch of sugar
--
This is just gonna give the yeast a little bit more to eat. Whisk those together
--
Let them stand at room temperature for about 5 minutes until foamy and add them to the shaggy ball of dough you have forming in
--
Your stand mixer as the extra water is fully absorbed
--
We're going to add in 2 tablespoons
--
Of kosher salt and then knead with the dough hook on medium speed for about 5 minutes when you're done
--
You're gonna be left with this very sticky dough, but do not fear. That's what we're after focaccia dough is usually very hydrated
--
So it has an open airy crumb we're gonna let it rise in a large
--
Generously oiled Bowl covered in plastic wrap for about 2 hours or until it has doubled in size
--
Now to continue encouraging gluten formation
--
We're going to fold the dough onto itself a couple times by pulling it away from the edges of the bowl
--
This might not look like much but it actually does a lot then we are hitting an 18 by
--
13 rimmed baking sheet or half sheet with about a half a cup of olive oil
--
This might seem like a lot but you could actually do even more than this and it would only make your focaccia better
--
We're gonna fold the dough onto itself a couple more times again to encourage gluten development and then it's time to start shaping it
--
Into the size of the pan. It might show some
--
resistance and spring back on you if it does oil it and cover it with plastic wrap for 15 minutes to let the gluten to
--
Relax, you might have to do this one or two times, but you will find by the end of this process
--
It will easily be coasts into the edges of the pan. Once you've got the pan filled out
--
it's time to generously oil the top of our dough cover once again in plastic wrap and
--
Ferment overnight in the fridge about 12 hours as you can see here. Mine is really large and bubbly
--
I kind of over fermented it so I'm popping bubbles and pulling it away from the sides of the pan so it doesn't stick in
--
the oven and then with oiled fingers
--
I'm placing those characteristic dimples on top of the focaccia
--
Hitting it with a little bit of olive oil and letting it come up to room temperature
--
Under plastic wrap about an hour while it's doing that
--
we are preheating our oven again for a full hour at
--
450 degrees Fahrenheit for giving this guy one last drizzle of oil and a generous sprinkle of big
--
flaky
--
Bolden's salt and popping it in the oven for about half an hour until it looks like this it should pull away from the pan
--
Pretty easily if you oiled it properly
--
If not, just try to get under there with a sharp spatula and scrape it off. Just like our other loaf of bread
--
We're letting this guy cool completely on a rack about an hour and a half before finally cracking him open first
--
We got to admire it a little bit. I mean look at it you made this
--
Well, I made this but you'll make the one that you make and if you think about it, that's pretty cool
--
This stuff works great for big fat Italian sandwiches like a praise a and prosciutto eaten with cheese or meats
--
and it's a pretty impressive relatively forgiving way to enter the world of bread baking but my favorite way to eat it is with
--
even more oil that is cut into strips like you get in a restaurant and dipped into a waiting pool of
--
Extra-virgin olive oil salt freshly ground pepper and what the hell some grated Parmesan cheese
--
I mean, we're making bread here not zucchini noodles. We might as well do it right
--
So I just want to talk a little bit about designing my new website with Squarespace
--
They have this really intuitive easy-to-use platform. That made it super easy
--
Even for somebody like me who's never done web design ever they have templates
--
They do domain stamp really good customer service is really an all-in-one one-stop shop for building a really slick website
--
And I was really happy with the way mine came out if you want to try it for yourself
