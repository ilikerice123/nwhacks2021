(lively music)(gentle music)- [Chef] So one of the key componentsof pot stickers is dumpling wrappers,and these are widely
available at Asian grocersbut if you can't find 'em,
here's how to make your own.We're simply mixing together 250 gramsof all-purpose flour with
130 milliliters of water,at first with a rubber
spatula or a wooden spoonand then our hands,until a shaggy bowl of dough
forms and no dry spots remain.Then we're covering with plastic wrapand allowing to rest at room
temperature for 10 minutes.This is gonna allow the flour to hydrate.Then we have to knead it
for about five minutesor until completely smooth.Obviously, you can do this by handbut a stand mixer is much easier.Pull it off the hook once or twicethroughout the kneading process,and knead for anywhere
from five to eight minuteson medium speed until soft,
and elastic, and supple.Then we are covering once againand allowing to rest for one hour,plenty of time to make our filling.Starting with one pound of ground pork,plop that into a large bowl
and start adding stuff.First off, one carrot peeled and gratedthrough the large holes
of a cheese grater,the green and white
parts of two scallions,roots removed and thinly sliced.Then something that is traditionalbut can be a little bit 
more difficultto find is Napa cabbage.We want about one cups worth,thinly sliced into julienne strips.You could substitute with green cabbagebut make sure that you cook it
first because it is tougher.We're also gonna add one
grated clove of garlicand some freshly peeled and
grated ginger to your taste.I usually go for about an inch worth.One whole egg, a tablespoon
of dark soy sauce,a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil,and a tablespoon of mirin.We also, of course, want
to season generouslywith kosher salt and
freshly ground black pepper.Now that everybody's in the van,it's time to get where we're going.That metaphor didn't really work.Just mix until evenly combined.And there you have it, our filling,which we're gonna cover and     
fridge for at least an hourso those flavors can
get to know each other.During which time,we're gonna negotiate
our dumpling wrappers.Now, traditionally, these
are rolled out one at a time,but if you're like meand you're continuing to
cheat using your stand mixer,the pasta rolling attachment
really works wonders.Our objective here is to get
the dough as thin as possible.So we're gonna start
on the widest setting,generously dusting the dough with flouras necessary to prevent stickage.And one notch at a 
time,
roll it out thinnerand thinner until we can roll no more.This is going to give us
beautifully thin-skinned,delicate little dumplings.Now beyond just being nontraditional,this method is a bit more wastefulbecause we're gonna use a
three-inch biscuit cutterto stamp out our individual wrappers.These, we are going to stack.Lightly dust it with flouruntil we've got about 30 wrappers.Even with my short cuts and cheats,this is still an arduous process.So if you can get these at the store,just get 'em at the store.Once we got everybody rolled out and cut,it's time to start filling.We're gonna place about two tablespoonsof our pork mixture in each wrapper,wet one side of the round  
with water using our finger,and seal the dumpling shut
using a series of pleats.Now, this takes a bit of practice,and as you're about to see,I'm going to discard my first onebecause I screwed it up.But in the process of
rolling about 30 of these,you're gonna figure it out.Let's see if we can glean some
information from the closeup.You're basically repeatedly
folding the wetted sideof the dumpling over itself,creating a decorative crimped edgeand naturally curving       
the seam of the dumpling.Once you've placed all your pleats,give it a little squeeze to seal it shut,and rinse and repeatwith the remaining filling and wrappers.There are definitely videos on YouTubethat illustrate this more clearly,so I will link to one in
the video description.Once you've got these all done and dusted,you can cook them or freeze
them right on the sheet tray,placing them in a plastic
bag once frozen solidfor an easy snack or appetizer any time.Whenever you're ready to eat
them, we need a dipping sauce.For that, we're gonna combine
1/2 a cup of soy saucewith a 1/4 cup of rice vinegar,
one tablespoon of sugar,about a 1/2 inch of grated
ginger, some sliced scallions,one tablespoon toasted sesame oil,a little squirt of sriracha
if that's your thing,and a 1/4 cup of water.Tiny whisk to combine
and taste for seasoning,adjusting however you want.This is your dumpling sauce.Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.Next and last, it's time
to cook our dumplings.We're adding about a
tablespoon of vegetable oilto a preheated nonstick skillet,arranging the dumplings
inside and allowing to fryfor about three minutes or
until blistered and brown.And now to cook them through,we're gonna add a big squirt
of water to the skillet,maybe about a 1/4 cup,
cover and allow to steamover medium-low heat for anywhere
from seven to 10 minutes.After which time, the
wrappers should be cooked,the bottom should be crisp,and the pork should be cooked through.Go ahead and arrange  
neatly and decorativelyon a plate with our dipping sauce.Make the dipping sauce live
up to its name and chow down.A nice light beer or a cloudy glassof sake completes the picture.And while these pot stickersare already stunningly delicious,there is a step that we can taketo make them even deliciouser.In a small bowl, we are
combining one teaspoon cornstarchwith a 1/2 teaspoon of all-purpose flour,tiny whisking to combine,and adding to 
about a 1/2 a cup of wateralong with a 1/4 teaspoon rice vinegar.Tiny whisk this until it
is a homogenous slurry,and then we're going to repeat
the dumpling cooking process.Lightly frying in a little bit of oiluntil they have browned
and bubbly bottoms,then we're going to arrange the dumplingsin a decorative pattern,and instead of splash of water,add our slurry until the
bottom of the pan is covered.Same as before, we're gonna coverand steam for about seven minutes.After which time, you'll remove the lidto discover a gross ectoplasmic gooaround the bottom of your dumplings.But do not despair,we're gonna keep cooking over medium heatuntil the goo dries out and
starts to lightly brown.Then, we're taking it off the heat,putting our plate directly
into the frying pan,and using it to invert
the dumplings, like so.Make sure you're wearing oven glovesto protect your delicate skin
from errant oil spatters,and behold, the wafer-thin,
delicate, crispy skirtaround the bottom of our dumplings.This both looks pretty niceand adds a whole lot of      
crunch to each and every bite,taking this dish from
great to really great.I really hope you guys try
this one for yourselves,'cause it's a really delicious
way to spend an afternoon,and pot stickers freeze
beautifully, and the cooking processfor frozen pot stickers is
virtually the same as fresh ones.I literally took some out
of the freezer and made themas I was doing the
voiceover for this episode.Really, really good, but oh, it's hot.Very, very hot.(upbeat music)
