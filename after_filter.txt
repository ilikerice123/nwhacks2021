A process that takes a little more than plain old flour, and turns it into something delicious
400 grams of bread flour. Bread flour has a higher protein content and, it's going to help us develop better gluten in our bread
To this we are going to add one gram, or 1/4 teaspoon, of any kind of yeast, instant or active dry
Of kosher salt. If you use table salt, keep it at 10 grams,
Then to this we're going to add one and 1/3 cups of room-temperature water. And here's where the easy part starts.
We're going to gently mix the whole affair together, until a rough ball of dough forms.
No kneading as they say. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours, or until it
Fermentation. And we're going to turn this out onto a very heavily floured work surface
We're not trying to work any of the flour into the dough. So make sure that you're not needing it
we're just grabbing the corners and pulling them in towards the center until we have a heavily floured smooth and taut top to our
Loaf once you've got a large round smooth surface start pulling the dough in towards the bottom
Shaping it into a little pool as it's called and placing onto some flour
Don't be a monster use a clean towel and flour it liberally so it does not stick to the dough because it's going to cover
The dough for the next one to two hours or until it has grown by about 50% not quite double during this time
cast-iron Dutch oven inside of it for at least an hour
It in place in the oven we're going to spray it down. Liberally with plain old water
We're and make this guy for about 30 minutes removing the lid and giving it one last spritz of water
But we've got to be patient and let this guy cool completely before digging in about two hours
Focaccia with a recipe adapted from bone Appetit into the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook affixed
We are dumping 850 grams of bread flour followed by 2 and 1/2 cups of room-temperature water
We're gonna mix those on low speed for a few minutes while they're mixing
We're going to combine a half a cup of water measuring about 105 degrees Fahrenheit with a whole packet of active dry yeast
along with a small pinch of sugar
This is just gonna give the yeast a little bit more to eat. Whisk those together
Let them stand at room temperature for about 5 minutes until foamy and add them to the shaggy ball of dough you have forming in
Your stand mixer as the extra water is fully absorbed
Of kosher salt and then knead with the dough hook on medium speed for about 5 minutes when you're done
You're gonna be left with this very sticky dough, but do not fear. That's what we're after focaccia dough is usually very hydrated
Generously oiled Bowl covered in plastic wrap for about 2 hours or until it has doubled in size
We're going to fold the dough onto itself a couple times by pulling it away from the edges of the bowl
13 rimmed baking sheet or half sheet with about a half a cup of olive oil
We're gonna fold the dough onto itself a couple more times again to encourage gluten development and then it's time to start shaping it
resistance and spring back on you if it does oil it and cover it with plastic wrap for 15 minutes to let the gluten to
it's time to generously oil the top of our dough cover once again in plastic wrap and
Ferment overnight in the fridge about 12 hours as you can see here. Mine is really large and bubbly
the oven and then with oiled fingers
Hitting it with a little bit of olive oil and letting it come up to room temperature
Under plastic wrap about an hour while it's doing that
we are preheating our oven again for a full hour at
450 degrees Fahrenheit for giving this guy one last drizzle of oil and a generous sprinkle of big
Bolden's salt and popping it in the oven for about half an hour until it looks like this it should pull away from the pan
Pretty easily if you oiled it properly
We're letting this guy cool completely on a rack about an hour and a half before finally cracking him open first
This stuff works great for big fat Italian sandwiches like a praise a and prosciutto eaten with cheese or meats
even more oil that is cut into strips like you get in a restaurant and dipped into a waiting pool of
Extra-virgin olive oil salt freshly ground pepper and what the hell some grated Parmesan cheese
I mean, we're making bread here not zucchini noodles. We might as well do it right
